## üõ†Ô∏è Visualization Techniques Overview

| Technique | Description | Suitable For |
|:----------|:------------|:-------------|
| **Animated Bubble Plot** (`gganimate`) | Dynamic visualization showing changes over time using position, size, and color encoding. | Time series trends across multiple variables. |
| **Interactive Dashboard** (`Tableau`) | User-driven exploration with filters, selectors, and linked views. | When users need flexible, multi-perspective data exploration. |
| **Raincloud Plot** (`ggplot2`, `cowplot`) | Combination of violin plot, boxplot, and jittered scatterplot. | Visualizing full distribution, density, and spread of data. |
| **Cartogram** (`cartogram`, `sf`) | Geographical distortion where area represents a data attribute rather than physical size. | When geographical size misleads data interpretation; emphasize magnitude. |
| **Choropleth Map** (`ggplot2`, `mapproj`) | Coloring regions based on data values. | Standard for showing geographical distribution. |
| **Heatmap with Faceting** (`ggmap`, `ggplot2`) | Density-based color mapping over geographic coordinates, split by categorical variables. | Spatial intensity analysis across conditions. |
| **Scatter Plot with Size Encoding** (`Tableau`) | Position plus size encoding to add a third dimension to 2D plots. | Multivariate numerical data. |
| **Treemap** (`Tableau`) | Hierarchical space-filling visualization showing proportions. | Comparing parts of a whole across two categorical levels. |
| **Bubble Chart** (`Tableau`) | Circles sized and colored by variables for categorical comparison. | Loose grouping and sizing by magnitude for categories. |

## üìö Datasets Used

| Dataset | Description | Source |
|:--------|:------------|:-------|
| **G20 Suicide Rate Dataset** | Suicide rates, GDP per capita, and population for G20 countries (1985‚Äì2015). | Public datasets from Kaggle and open statistical repositories. |
| **Perception Experiment Dataset** | Experimental results measuring visual decoding accuracy across different encoding methods. | Provided as part of DSC465 Data Visualization course at DePaul University. |
| **Messier Object Catalog** | Astronomical catalog listing object types, distances, magnitudes, and angular sizes. | Public astronomical data (Messier Catalog). |
| **Food Service Availability Data** | Availability of food service establishments by U.S. state and county. | U.S. Census Bureau and public shapefile repositories. |
| **Chicago Car Crash Data** | Geolocated crash incidents in Chicago during June 2019, with lighting condition metadata. | Chicago Open Data Portal. |
| **GM Car Price Dataset** | Car make, model, and sale price data for different vehicle types. | Educational dataset used in coursework. |

## üìù Notes

- All datasets were used solely for educational, learning, and portfolio demonstration purposes.
- Some visualizations (e.g., cartogram) involve data transformation and re-projection for enhanced insight delivery.
